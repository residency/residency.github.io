<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghalimi">Ismael Chang Ghalimi</a>. I am a frequent traveler with <a href="https://www.united.com/">United Airlines</a> (150K+ miles/year), and a high-frequency guest with <a href="http://www.hyatt.com/">Hyatt</a> (150+ nights/year). After 20+ years of nomadism, I have decided to settle down. While the world remains my oyster, I do not want to be a visitor or a guest anymore. I want to be a resident, several places at a time, and this website documents every step of the move to my new home.</p>

<h1><a name="style"></a>Select your style</h1>
<p>Following my <a href="http://less.best/">less.best</a> reductionist philosophy, I do not own any dwelling. Instead, I rent the place where I spend the majority of my time (currently in Palo Alto, CA), and I stay at hotels the rest of the year.</p>
<p>In order to make these hotels my home away from home, I use a single hospitality brand for all my stays. Depending on your regular destinations and personal preferences, you might want to select one brand or another. Mine is <a href="http://www.hyatt.com/">Hyatt</a>, because it manages great properties in most of the places where I want to go, while remaining relatively small. This is helping them deliver a highly-personalized guest experience, especially at their <a href="http://park.hyatt.com/">Park Hyatt</a> properties.</p>

<h1><a name="home"></a>Pick your home</h1>
<p>Once you have selected your hospitality brand and joined their loyalty program (if they have one), you will want to select the properties where you will spend most of your time at your most frequent destinations.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you do not have a choice. For example, most of my business in London is done with large financial institutions, which have their main offices in The City. Therefore, I stay at the <a href="http://london.liverpoolstreet.andaz.hyatt.com/">Andaz Liverpool Street</a>, rather than the <a href="http://london.churchill.hyatt.com/">Hyatt Regency London</a> (both are great properties).</p>
<p>But in New York, I have plenty of options, since my customers are split between the Financial District and Midtown. In such a case, I try the most promising properties a few times, during separate stays at different seasons of the year, before selecting the one that I will call home. In Manhattan, it is the <a href="http://newyork.park.hyatt.com/">Park Hyatt New York</a>, which is the only one to offer a dry sauna (a must after a long flight).</p>
<p>Normally, I could not justify the expense of staying at such a luxury property on a regular basis, but half of my nights there are paid with points, since I accrue them faster than I can redeem them for vacations. With that in mind, when selecting a hospitality brand, make sure that its loyalty program will let you redeem points at the properties where you will want to stay. In that respect, some programs are definitely better than others.</p>

<h1><a name="move"></a>Move in</h1>
<p>After you have picked your home, it is time to move in. Of all the things that I have tried over the years, none can turn a hotel room into your home away from home like a suitcase or a trunk that you can leave at the front desk when you check out, then retrieve next time you check back in.</p>
<p>In the early days of my globetrotting lifestyle, I even went as far as designing my own trunk, which drew its inspiration from the classical Louis Vuitton trunk. But the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/84112962@N00/sets/72157606405587450/">Monolab Trunk</a> was too large and too heavy to be practical. Today, I settle for a <a href="http://www.rimowa.com/en-us/topas-multiwheel-98l-silver-suitcase/923.77.00.4">Rimowa Topas Multiwheel 98l</a>, which has a huge capacity, yet is very light. In it, I store the following things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clothes for 7 days folded in <a href="http://www.tumi.com/p/large-packing-cube-014896D">Tumi packing cubes</a></li>
  <li>A pair of <a href="https://monocle.com/shop/homeware/other/lana-cotton-slippers-by-kontex/">slippers by Monocle</a> (more comfortable than standard-issue hotel ones)</li>
  <li>An <a href="http://goodhoodstore.com/store/11904">aroma diffuser by Monocle</a> (to have the same scent in every room)</li>
  <li>Dental care and cosmetics supplies in a toiletry bag</li>
  <li>Lens wipes for my glasses</li>
  <li>Organic snacks</li>
  <li>Bottle of wine</li>
  <li>Business cards</li>
  <li>27" Apple iMac computer</li>
</ul>
<p>Most hotels will let you leave a piece of luggage between stays, but only if you have a forward reservation. Nevertheless, after some discussions with Hyatt executives and hotel General Managers, I can now leave a suitcase in the four locations where I travel the most: New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo. Two have already found homes in New York and Paris, one will be left in London next week, and the last one will land at the legendary <a href="http://tokyo.park.hyatt.com/">Park Hyatt Tokyo</a> early next year.</p>
<p>Having such a setup at every location where I travel the most, I can afford to carry nothing more than a messenger bag (<a href="http://www.onabags.com/store/messenger-bags/the-brixton.html?color=antique-cognac">Ona Brixton</a>), which contains my laptop, my camera, a single change of underwear (just in case), and a small toiletry bag with my electric toothbrush and electric shaver. This allows me to pack in less than 5 minutes, and reduces the amount of luggage that I have to carry with me at the airport.</p>

<h1><a name="familiar"></a>Make it familiar</h1>
<p>Many of the items that I leave in my sedentary suitcases are there to make my hotel rooms as familiar as possible, taking advantage of all five sensory interfaces that I am blessed with:</p>
<p><strong>Hearing:</strong> My Spotify playlist played on the iMac.</p>
<p><strong>Sight:</strong> Pictures of my beloved ones displayed on the iMac.</p>
<p><strong>Smell:</strong> Hinoki scent diffused from the flameless diffuser.</p>
<p><strong>Taste:</strong> A good bottle of my favorite red wine.</p>
<p><strong>Touch:</strong> Warm and soft slippers on my feet.</p>
<p>When I am sitting down in my room, I could close my eyes, and not be able to tell that I am 10,000 miles away from home. In fact, this is my home. It just so happens that I have the extraordinary privilege of having several of them around the world.</p>
