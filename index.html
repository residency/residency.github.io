                        <p class="lead tip">Sometimes, you do not have a choice. For example, most of my business in London is done with large financial institutions, which have their main offices in The City. Therefore, I always stay at the <a href="http://london.liverpoolstreet.andaz.hyatt.com/" target="external">Andaz Liverpool Street</a>, rather than the <a href="http://london.churchill.hyatt.com/" target="external">Hyatt Regency London</a>.</p>
                        <p class="lead tip">But in New York, I have plenty of options, since my customers are split between the Financial District and Midtown. In such a case, I try the most promising properties a few times, during separate stays at different seasons of the year, before selecting the one that I will eventually call home. In Midtown, I really like the <a href="http://newyork.5thavenue.andaz.hyatt.com/" target="external">Andaz 5th Avenue</a>.</p>

                        <p class="lead tip">In the early days of my globetrotting lifestyle, I even went as far as designing my own trunk, which drew inspiration from the classical Louis Vuitton Trunk. But the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/84112962@N00/sets/72157606405587450/" target="external">Monolab Trunk</a> was too large and too heavy to be practical.

                        <p class="lead tip">Most hotels will allow you to leave a piece of luggage between stays, but only if you have a forward reservation. Nevertheless, after discussions with some Hyatt executives and the General Managers of the hotels that I have selected, I can now leave a suitcase in my four primary locations (New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo).</p>
                        <p class="lead tip">Having such a setup at every residence, I can afford to carry nothing more than a messenger bag (<a href="http://www.onabags.com/store/messenger-bags/the-brixton.html?color=antique-cognac" target="external">ONA Brixton</a>), which contains my laptop, my camera, a single change of underwear (just in case), and a toiletry bag with some supplies, an electric shaver, and an electric toothbrush. This allows me to pack in less than 5 minutes, and reduce the amount of luggage that I have to carry at the airport.</p>

                        <p class="lead tip">First, you can outfit your in-residence suitcase with items bought online and shipped to the hotel, or items bought on site. To make it even easier, I standardize most of my in-residence belongings and supplies with items that can be bought from virtually any country, using global brands like Apple or Uniqlo (great for underwear).</p>
                        <p class="lead tip">Second, you can get your clothes washed by the hotel between two consecutive stays. To do so, make an arrangement with your hotel, then leave a washbag in your bedroom before check-out. And if you are a high-frequency guest and only need to get your underwear washed and folded (no dry cleaning nor ironing), you can usually negotiate a much better rate with the hotel's laundry service.</p>

                        <p class="lead margin-btm-30 checklist">
                          <strong>Hearing:</strong> My Spotify tunes playing on the iMac.<br>
                          <strong>Sight:</strong> Pictures of my beloved ones displayed on the iMac.<br>
                          <strong>Smell:</strong> Hinoki scent diffused from a flameless diffuser.<br>
                          <strong>Taste:</strong> Sip from a bottle of my favorite red wine.<br>
                          <strong>Touch:</strong> Warm and soft slippers wrapped around my feet.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead tip">In my room, I could close my eyes, and forget that I am 10,000 miles away from home. In fact, this is my home. It just so happens that I found a way to clone it in several places around the world.</p>
                        <p class="lead tip">Another trick is to book the same room whenever you come back to the same property. And as you become more familiar with a property, you will discover which room is the best for you. For example, my favorite room at the legendary <a href="http://tokyo.park.hyatt.com/" target="external">Park Hyatt Tokyo</a> is a corner room with a view on Fuji-san. At sunset, it is breathtaking.</p>
                        <p class="lead tip">Unfortunately, most hotel reservation websites do not let you select your hotel room like you can select any given seat on an airplane. Nevertheless, you can usually request a particular room by adding a comment to your reservation. And if you are a high-frequency guest, you can work with your loyalty program manager to develop a very detailed profile that will be used in the background to select the best possible room when making a reservation.</p>

                        <p class="lead tip">Now that you have settled in your new abode, you can think of making it as comfortable as possible. For me, that means sitting on a real office chair when working from my room. Often, I will spend 12 to 14 hours a day in front of my computer, and chairs are usually selected by hotel designers for best look rather than proper ergonomics. Unfortunately, I have not found a way to replicate the <a href="https://ishizeno.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/l1000661.jpg" target="external">stand up desk</a> that I have in Palo Alto, but most hotel managers are kind enough to outfit my room with a proper office chair during my stays.</p>
                        <p class="text-center"><img src="img/chair.jpg" width="50%"></p>
                        <p class="lead tip">Another way to increase the comfort of your residence is to stream music or videos from your laptop or smartphone to the TV set usually installed in your room. Some hotels, like the <a href="http://paris.madeleine.hyatt.com/" target="external">Hyatt Paris Madeleine</a>, made it really easy by adding an <a href="http://www.apple.com/tv/" target="external">Apple TV</a> to every TV. Others do not, but you can usually connect your own Apple TV or <a href="https://www.google.com/chromecast" target="external">Chromecast</a>.</p>
                        <p class="text-center"><img src="img/apple-tv.jpg" width="25%"></p>
                        <p class="lead tip">With such a setup, I can now use the TV to listen to my Spotify tunes, or watch the 900 movies of the <a href="http://www.hulu.com/movies/criterion" target="external">Criterion Collection</a> on Hulu. And let me tell you this: watching your favorite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Kurosawa" target="external">Akira Kurosawa</a> movie from the 45<sup>th</sup> floor of the best hotel in Shinjuku is quite special. Only thing to remember: subscribe to a good VPN service in order to circumvent streaming limitations from foreign countries.</p>
                        <p class="text-center"><img src="img/kurosawa.gif" width="50%"></p>
                        <p class="lead tip">As an audiophile, one thing I miss on the road is a good sound system. Today, I leave a <a href="http://grainaudio.com/products/pws" target="external">Grain Audio PWS</a> portable wireless speaker in one of my suitcases. It offers excellent value for the money, but it can hardly qualify as an audiophile piece of equipment, and sound coming out of it is a modest improvement over the iMac's. In the future, I will most likely leave an audiophile headset and preamplifier in every suitcase. The <a href="https://www.audeze.com/products/lcd-collection/lcd-3" target="external">Audeze LCD-3</a> and <a href="http://hifiman.com/he1000/index.asp" target="external">HiFiMAN HE1000</a> are on top of my list.</p>
                        <p class="text-center"><img src="img/hifiman.jpg" width="25%"></p>
                        <p class="lead tip">After a good night of sleep, you might want a nice cup of coffee to give your day a proper start. More and more, prime Hyatt properties outfit their rooms with <a href="https://www.nespresso.com/" target="external">Nespresso</a> machines, which make the absolute best brew from recyclable capsules. Unfortunately, other properties like the <a href="http://london.liverpoolstreet.andaz.hyatt.com/" target="external">Andaz Liverpool Street</a> provide these in suites only. As a result, my very first in-residence suitcase was home to a marvellous candy red apple <a href="https://www.nespresso.com/us/en/kitchenaid-machines-range" target="external">Nespresso by KitchenAid</a> machine. But the good folks at Hyatt have decided to make my life even easier, and are now providing a Nespresso machine in all four residences, whether I'm staying in a suite or not. Bliss!</p>
                        <p class="text-center"><img src="img/nespresso.png" width="35%"></p>
                        <p class="lead tip">Finally, I travel a lot because I like meeting customers and coworkers face-to-face, the old-fashioned way. And because my team is scattered around the world with offices in Palo Alto, New York, London, Paris, and Singapore, my trips usually cross seven timezones or more. As a result, I try to keep them as short as practically possible (like a single-day roundtrip from San Francisco to Sydney), or to make them as long as possible (one week at least, two to three sometimes), but nothing in between (jet lag kicks in after two or three days).</p>
                        <p class="text-center"><img src="img/imac.jpg" width="50%"></p>
                        <p class="lead tip">During these long stays, I usually spend many days working from my hotel room for extended periods of time. In such cases, having a large computer monitor increases my productivity dramatically, and with a declining eyesight, a retina display is a godsend. For all these reasons, I now pack a <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/" target="external">27-inch 5K iMac</a> computer in every in-residence suitcase. It is a significant investment, but the productivity gains after a few stays make up for it manyfold.</p>

                        <p class="lead tip">From time to time, I need to host some coworkers or partners. I could rent a meeting room at the hotel or in some coworking facility like Regus or WeWork, but I usually prefer to hold such meetings from my hotel room, which saves me time and money.</p>
                        <p class="lead tip">To do so, I try to get an upgrade to an executive suite, using either my status or a suite upgrade voucher. In fact, this is the only instance when I really need a suite upgrade (beside vacations with my family), and I shared that fact with Hyatt executives and hotel managers, allowing them to use their limited pool of available suites for guests who really want them, in a pay it forward kind of way.</p>
                        <p class="lead tip">Before requesting a suite upgrade for holding a business meeting or a long working session, I usually try to visit a few suites at the hotel beforehand, looking for one suitable for the function that I will host. In some cases, the room manager will be kind enough to add a few chairs to my suite to accomodate all my guests. Sometimes, I can request a paperboard or a whiteboard. And I use the room's TV set or my 27-inch iMac to project slides or share a screen. Finally, having a nice Nespresso machine supplied with plenty of coffee capsules is a great way to keep my guests happy and sharp.</p>

For that purpose, I usually try to locate a few places of interest at walking distance from my hotel (15 minutes or less):</p>
                        <p class="lead margin-btm-30 checklist">
                          Favorite restaurant (for entertaining customers)<br>
                          Favorite bar (for entertaining friends)<br>
                          Favorite sushi place (I love sushi!)<br>
                          Favorite wine bar (with cold cuts and good cheese)<br>
                          Favorite chocolatier (dark chocolate is de rigueur)<br>
                          Favorite park (for a morning run or an evening stroll)<br>
                          Apple store (for most of my electronic needs)<br>
                          Leica store (to try out new lenses)<br>
                          Monocle store (to get some inspiration and meet like-minded people)<br>
                          Kiosk (to buy the latest copy of Monocle if no store is in town)<br>
                          Grocery store (for Kombucha tea)<br>
                          Pharmacy (for various supplies)<br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead tip">In order to keep a tab on all these places, I have put together a small online spreadsheet with addresses, contacts, and links to websites. Then, I annotate a Google map with all the streets that I have visited, going through larger and larger concentric circles around my hotel. This allows me to practice my street photography, while increasing the odds of discovering some unique spots along the way.</p>
                        <p class="lead tip">Last but not least, I use the fabulous <a href="http://monocle.com/magazine/archive/" target="external">Monocle Archive</a> to discover some local artisans that I should meet, allowing me to refine my small <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15BhBH7hhfflJ93x9F4tUeJ53hqeVfUhVm3Rg1_GCljY/edit#gid=1114977856" target="external">inventory</a> of earthly possessions, and to learn more about old crafts. One day, I hope to retire at a relatively young age, and become an apprentice with some of these masters, one to three months at a time. On my list: grinding tea leaves with a matcha master, sanding wood for a goban maker, or preparing rice for a sushi chef.</a>

But she is one who shares my lifestyle to quite a large extent, since she spends most of her life in a hotel, and usually moves to a new property every four or five years. In such a context, I can rely on this person to provide good recommendations for some of the hotel's features, services, and nearby places of interest.</p>
                        <p class="lead tip">Therefore, I usually try to have breakfast with the General Manager of every property that I stay at. Through that meeting, I collect some useful contact information (reservation manager in particular), identify the rooms that are likely to suit me the most, and learn about local customs, like whether or not you should tip in Japan (don't).</p>
                        <p class="lead tip">Most importantly, I try to reciprocate by providing constructive feedback on my guest experience, at the current hotel, but also other hotels that I reside at, and which might provide some unique services. Then, I never forget to promote the use of Nespresso machines and <a href="http://www.totousa.com/products/washlets" target="external">TOTO washlets</a>, or the installation of a dry sauna (a must).</p>

As a result, most of my outbound flights from San Francisco to Europe tend to arrive very early in the morning. In such cases, my room might not be ready at check-in time, but good hotels can accomodate my wait in two ways: first, some hotels have a spa with a shower that I can use in order to refresh myself before an important meeting; second, the best hotels will make a temporary room available so that I can take a quick nap before my room is ready.</p>

                        <p class="lead tip">Ever since I flew an <a href="http://sonsofader.tumblr.com/">air safari</a> in Namibia, I have known that the best way to really know a place is to visit it both from the ground (hiking) and from the air (aviating). Overflying a city or a countryside is a fantastic way to develop a better sense of its geography, and to develop a more faithful mental picture for it.</p>
                        <p class="lead tip">With that in mind, I always try to visit my new places of residence from the air, either by taking a flying lesson at a local flight school (I'm an instrument-rated private pilot), or by hiring a small rotorcraft with friends (New-York and Honolulu are great for that). With proper planning, it's a lot cheaper than most people might think, and it creates some of the best memories that money can buy.</p>

                      <p class="lead tip">Most of my traveling is done for business, but I also like to travel with my family for vacations. Then, I take advantage of the massive amounts of points that I accrued over the years to treat ourselves at some exceptional properties. Next year, we are planning to stay at the <a href="http://beavercreek.hyatt.com/" target="external">Park Hyatt Beaver Creek</a> for skiing, and the <a href="http://maui.andaz.hyatt.com/" target="external">Andaz Maui</a> for diving. And during the Summer, we will travel through Western Europe, visiting cities like Zurich, Berlin, Vienna, Milan, and Cannes.</p>
                      <p class="lead tip">There, I become a guest again in most properties, but I am thinking of ways that I could transform some of them into secondary residences. For example, I might leave my snowboard, boots, and outfit at the <a href="http://laketahoe.hyatt.com/" target="external">Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort</a>, where we could go skiing two or three times a year. Or some diving gear at the <a href="http://kauai.hyatt.com/">Grand Hyatt Kauai</a> or the <a href="http://maui.andaz.hyatt.com/" target="external">Andaz Maui</a> (<a href="http://molokinicrater.com/" target="external">Molokini Crater</a> is a blast).</p>
                      <p class="lead tip">Sometimes, I travel for business, but I need a break. In that case, I will take one or two days off, making up for all the week-ends that were spent working. For example, if I stay for a week in Tokyo, I usually try to spend a night at the excellent <a href="http://kyoto.regency.hyatt.com/" target="external">Hyatt Regency Kyoto</a>, which is a short bullet train ride from Shinjuku, or at the <a href="http://hakone.regency.hyatt.com/" target="external">Hyatt Regency Hakone</a>. The latter takes a bit longer to reach, but the new <a href="http://hakone.regency.hyatt.com/en/hotel/dining/Berce.html" target="external">Berce</a> restaurant is definitely worth the trip, and the hotel itself is quite special.</p>
                      <p class="lead tip">And if I am short on time, I will just leave the <a href="http://tokyo.park.hyatt.com/" target="external">Park Hyatt Tokyo</a> for a night, and stay at the <a href="http://tokyo.andaz.hyatt.com/" target="external">Andaz Tokyo</a>, making sure to get a reservation at <a href="http://tokyo.andaz.hyatt.com/en/hotel/dining/the-sushi.html" target="external">The Sushi</a>, which can only accomodate eight guests, and where you get your dedicated chef for the entire dinner. It is quite a treat...</p>
