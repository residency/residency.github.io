<h1>Residency</h1>
<p>Lifestyle tips for high-frequency travelers</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghalimi">Ismael Chang Ghalimi</a>. I am a frequent flyer with <a href="https://www.united.com/">United Airlines</a> (200K+ miles/year), and a high-frequency guest with <a href="http://www.hyatt.com/">Hyatt</a> (150+ nights/year). After 20+ years of nomadism, I want to settle down. While the world remains my oyster, I do not want to be a visitor or a guest anymore. I want to be a resident, several places at a time, and this website documents every step of my global sedentarization.</p>

<h2><a name="style"></a>Select your style</h2>
<p>Following my <a href="http://less.best/">less.best</a> reductionist philosophy, I do not own any dwelling. Instead, I rent the place where I spend the majority of my time (in Palo Alto, CA), and I stay at hotels the rest of the year.</p>
<p>In order to make these hotels my home away from home, I use a single hospitality brand for all my stays. Depending on your regular destinations and personal preferences, you might want to select one brand or another. Mine is <a href="http://www.hyatt.com/">Hyatt</a>, because it manages great properties in most of the places where I want to go, while remaining relatively small. This is helping them deliver a highly-personalized guest experience.</p>

<h2><a name="home"></a>Pick your home</h2>
<p>Once you have selected your hospitality brand and joined their loyalty program (if they have one), you will want to select the properties where you will stay at your most frequent destinations.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you do not have a choice. For example, most of my business in London is done with large financial institutions, which have their main offices in The City. Therefore, I stay at the <a href="http://london.liverpoolstreet.andaz.hyatt.com/">Andaz Liverpool Street</a>, rather than the <a href="http://london.churchill.hyatt.com/">Hyatt Regency London</a> (both are great properties).</p>
<p>But in New York, I have plenty of options, since my customers are split between the Financial District and Midtown. In such a case, I try the most promising properties a few times, during separate stays at different seasons of the year, before selecting the one that I will call home. In Manhattan, it is the <a href="http://newyork.park.hyatt.com/">Park Hyatt New York</a>, which is the only one to offer a dry sauna (a must after a long flight).</p>
<p>Normally, I could not justify the expense of staying at such a luxury property, but half of my nights there are paid with points, since I accrue them faster than I can redeem them for vacations. With that in mind, when selecting a hospitality brand, check that its loyalty program will let you redeem points at your selected properties. In that respect, some programs are definitely better than others.</p>

<h2><a name="move"></a>Move in</h2>
<p>After you have picked your home, it is time to move in. Of all the things that I have tried over the years, none can turn a hotel room into your home-away-from-home like a suitcase or a trunk that you can leave at the front desk when you check out, then retrieve next time you check back in.</p>
<p>In the early days of my globetrotting lifestyle, I even went as far as designing my own trunk, which drew inspiration from the classical Louis Vuitton Trunk. But the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/84112962@N00/sets/72157606405587450/">Monolab Trunk</a> was too large and too heavy to be practical. Today, I settle for a <a href="http://www.rimowa.com/en-us/topas-multiwheel-98l-silver-suitcase/923.77.00.4">Rimowa Topas Multiwheel 98l</a>, which has a huge capacity, yet is very light. In it, I store the following things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clothes for seven days folded in <a href="http://www.tumi.com/p/large-packing-cube-014896D">Tumi packing cubes</a></li>
  <li>A complete swimming outfit (swim trunk, goggles, cap)</li>
  <li>A complete workout outfit (running shoes, shorts, t-shirt)</li>
  <li>A pair of <a href="https://monocle.com/shop/homeware/other/lana-cotton-slippers-by-kontex/">slippers by Monocle</a> (more comfortable than standard-issue hotel ones)</li>
  <li>An <a href="http://goodhoodstore.com/store/11904">aroma diffuser by Monocle</a> (to have the same scent in every room)</li>
  <li>Dental care and cosmetics supplies in a toiletry bag</li>
  <li>Shaver and toothbrush chargers</li>
  <li>Lens wipes for my glasses</li>
  <li>Organic snacks</li>
  <li>Bottle of wine</li>
  <li>Business cards</li>
  <li>Apple 27-inch 5K iMac computer</li>
</ul>
<p>Most hotels will let you leave a piece of luggage between stays, but only if you have a forward reservation. Nevertheless, after discussions with some Hyatt executives and the General Managers of the hotels that I have selected, I can now leave a suitcase in the four locations where I travel the most (New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo).</p>
<p>Having such a setup at every residence, I can afford to carry nothing more than a messenger bag (<a href="http://www.onabags.com/store/messenger-bags/the-brixton.html?color=antique-cognac">Ona Brixton</a>), which contains my laptop, my camera, a single change of underwear (just in case), and a small toiletry bag with my electric shaver and electric toothbrush. This allows me to pack in less than 5 minutes, and reduces the amount of luggage that I have to carry with me at the airport.</p>

<h2><a name="easy"></a>Make it easy</h2>
<p>Now that you have gotten rid of any checked-in luggage and reduced your carried-on luggage to a small bag, you cannot afford to lug anything of significant mass or volume onto the plane. Therefore, a few tips are in order.</p>
<p>First, you can outfit your in-residence suitcase with items that you bought online and shipped to the hotel, or items that you bought on site. To make it even easier, I standardize most of my in-residence belongings and supplies with items that can be bought from virtually any country, using global brands like Apple, Rimowa, or Uniqlo (excellent value for underwear).</p>
<p>Second, you can get your clothes washed by the hotel between two consecutive stays. To do so, make an arrangement with your hotel, then leave a washbag in your bedroom before check-out. And if you are a high-frequency guest and only need to get your underwear washed and folded (no dry cleaning nor ironing), you can usually negotiate a much better rate with the hotel's laundry service.</p>

<h2><a name="familiar"></a>Make it familiar</h2>
<p>Many of the items that I leave in my in-residence suitcases are there to make my hotel rooms as familiar as possible, taking advantage of all five senses:</p>
<p><strong>Hearing:</strong> My Spotify tunes playing on the iMac.</p>
<p><strong>Sight:</strong> Pictures of my beloved ones displayed on the iMac.</p>
<p><strong>Smell:</strong> Hinoki scent diffused from a flameless diffuser.</p>
<p><strong>Taste:</strong> A sip from a good bottle of my favorite red wine.</p>
<p><strong>Touch:</strong> Warm and soft slippers on my feet.</p>
<p>In my room, I could close my eyes, and forget that I am 10,000 miles away from home. In fact, this is my home. It just so happens that I found a way to clone it in several places around the world.</p>
<p>Another way to make your room as familiar as possible is to book the same room whenever you come back to the same property. That way, you will always know where to find the light switch, even when jet lags wakes you up in the middle of the night. And as you become more familiar with a property, you will discover which rooms match your preferences best. For example, my favorite room at the legendary <a href="http://tokyo.park.hyatt.com/">Park Hyatt Tokyo</a> is a corner room with a view on Fuji-san.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most hotel reservation websites do not let you select your hotel room like you could select a seat on an airplane. Nevertheless, you can usually request a particular room by adding a comment to your reservation. And if you are a high-frequency guest, you can work with your loyalty program manager to develop a very detailed profile that will be used in the background to select the best possible room when making a reservation.</p>

<h2><a name="comfortable"></a>Make it comfortable</h2>
<p>Now that you have settled in your new abode, you can think of making it as comfortable as possible. For me, that means sitting on a real office chair when working from my room. Often, I will spend 12 to 14 hours a day in front of my computer, and chairs are usually selected by hotel designers for best look rather than proper ergonomics. Unfortunately, I have not found a way to replicate the <a href="https://ishizeno.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/l1000661.jpg">stand up desk</a> that I have in Palo Alto, but most hotel managers are kind enough to outfit my room with a proper office chair during my stays. Total back saver!</p>
<p>Another way to increase the comfort of your room is to stream music or videos from your laptop or smartphone to the TV set usually installed in your room. Some hotels, like the excellent <a href="http://paris.madeleine.hyatt.com/">Hyatt Paris Madeleine</a>, made it really easy by adding an <a href="http://www.apple.com/tv/">Apple TV</a> to every TV set. Others do not, but you can usually connect your own Apple TV or <a href="https://www.google.com/chromecast">Google Chromecast</a>. With such a setup, I can now use the TV to listen to my Spotify tunes, or watch the 900 movies of the <a href="http://www.hulu.com/movies/criterion">Criterion Collection</a> now offered by Hulu. And let me tell you this: watching your favorite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a> movie from the 45th floor of the best hotel in Shinjuku is quite special. Only thing to remember: subscribe to a good VPN service in order to circumvent streaming limitations in freign countries. As far as I can tell, it is perfectly legal, and if it is not, it certainly should be.</p>
<p>As an audiophile, one thing I miss when traveling is a good sound system. Today, I leave a <a href="http://grainaudio.com/products/pws">Grain Audio PWS</a> portable wireless speaker in one of my suitcases. It offers excellent value for the money, but it can hardly qualify as an audiophile piece of equipment, and sound coming out of it is a modest improvement over the one produced by my iMac computer. In the future, I will most likely leave an audiophile headset and preamplifier in every suitcase. The <a href="https://www.audeze.com/products/lcd-collection/lcd-3">Audeze LCD-3</a> and <a href="http://hifiman.com/he1000/index.asp">HiFiMAN HE1000</a> are pretty high on my list right now.</p>
<p>After a good night of sleep, you might want a nice cup of coffee to give your day a proper start. More and more, prime Hyatt properties outfit their rooms with <a href="https://www.nespresso.com/">Nespresso</a> machines, which make the absolute best brew from fully-recyclable capsules. Unfortunately, other properties like the <a href="http://london.liverpoolstreet.andaz.hyatt.com/">Andaz Liverpool Street</a> provide these in suites only. As a result, my first in-residence suitcase was home to a marvellous candy red apple <a href="https://www.nespresso.com/us/en/kitchenaid-machines-range">Nespresso by KitchenAid</a> machine. But the good folks at Hyatt have decided to make my life even easier, and are now providing a Nespresso machine in all four residences, whether I'm staying in a suite or not. How is that for personalized service?</p>
<p>Finally, I travel a lot because I like meeting customers and coworkers face-to-face, the old-fashioned way. And because my team is scattered around the world with offices in Palo Alto, New York, London, Paris, and Singapore, my trips usually cross seven timezones or more. As a result, I try to keep them as short as possible (sometimes less than a day), or to make them as long as possible (one week at least, two to three weeks sometimes), but nothing in between (jet lag kicks in after two or three days). And during these long stays, I usually spend many days working from my hotel room for very long periods of time. In such cases, having a large computer monitor increases my productivity dramatically, and with a declining eyesight, a 4K or 5K monitor is a godsend. For all these reasons, I now store a <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac/">27-inch 5K iMac</a> computer in every in-residence suitcase. It is a significant investment, but the productivity gains after a few stays make up for it manyfold.</p>

<h2><a name="office"></a>Make it your office</h2>
<p>From time to time, I need to host some coworkers or partners. I could rent a meeting room at the hotel or in some coworking facility like <a href="http://www.regus.com/">Regus</a> or <a href="https://www.wework.com/">WeWork</a>, but I usually prefer to hold such meetings from my hotel room, which saves me time and money.</p>
<p>To do so, I try to get an upgrade to an executive suite, using either my status or a suite upgrade voucher. In fact, this is the only instance when I really need a suite upgrade (beside vacations with my family), and I shared that fact with Hyatt executives and hotel managers, allowing them to use their limited pool of available suites for guests who really want them.</p>
<p>Before requesting a suite upgrade for holding a business meeting or a long working session, I usually try to visit a few suites at the hotel beforehand, ensuring that it will be suitable for the function that I am hosting. In some cases, the room manager will be kind enough to add a few chairs to my suite to accomodate all my guests. Sometimes, I can request a paperboard or a whiteboard. And I use the room's TV set or my 27-inch iMac to project slides or share a screen. Finally, having a nice Nespresso machine supplied with plenty of coffee capsules is a great way to keep my guests happy and sharp.</p>

<h2><a name="neighbourhood"></a>Know your neighbourhood</h2>
<p>Once you switch your mindset from being a guest to becoming a resident, it gets a lot easier to open up to the world around you. Then, you will want to discover your city of residence in more depth, starting with your hotel's neighbourhood. For that purpose, I usually try to locate the following places at walking distance from my hotel (15 minutes or less):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Favorite restaurant (for entertaining customers)</li>
  <li>Favorite bar (for entertaining friends)</li>
  <li>Favorite sushi place (I love sushi!)</li>
  <li>Favorite wine bar (I love good red wine, in moderation)</li>
  <li>Favorite chocolatier (I love dark chocolate)</li>
  <li>Favorite park (for a morning run or an evening stroll)</li>
  <li>Apple store (for most of my electronic needs)</li>
  <li>Leica store (to try out new lenses for my Leica M body)</li>
  <li>Monocle store (to get some inspiration and meet like-minded people)</li>
  <li>Grocery store (for Kombucha tea)</li>
  <li>Pharmacy (for various supplies)</li>
</ul>
