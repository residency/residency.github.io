<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghalimi">Ismael Chang Ghalimi</a>. I am a frequent traveler with <a href="https://www.united.com/">United Airlines</a> (150K+ miles/year), and a high-frequency guest with <a href="http://www.hyatt.com/">Hyatt</a> (150+ nights/year). After 20+ years of nomadism, I have decided to settle down. While the world remains my oyster, I do not want to be a visitor or a guest anymore. I want to be a resident, several places at a time, and this website documents every step of the move to my new home.</p>
